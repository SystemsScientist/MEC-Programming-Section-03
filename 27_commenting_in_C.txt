Section 03: Commenting in 'C'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comments I 

	Generally Comments are used to provide the description
	or documentation about the code you have written

	Through commenting, you can mention important notes,
	briefly explain behavior of the code, and other useful
	details

	Comments help the developer understand the logic/algorithm
	of the code if he/she revisits it after a long time

	You can mention the comments anywhere you want in the program
	and your comments will be ignored by the compiler

	Comments do not affect program or they do not consume any
	program memory space

	They are not part of the final executable generated
	
	It is there just for documentation purposes


Comments II

	In C, there are two types of comments:

		Single line comment

		Multi-line comment
	
	Single line comments

		Single line comments can be provided using //.......

	Multi-line comments

		Multiple line comments can be provided using
		/*................*/


Multi-line Comments Example

	/* 
	   C standard library header file inclusion
	   This is comment line 1
	   This is comment line 2
	   This is comment line 3
	   This is comment line 4
